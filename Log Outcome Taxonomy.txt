  - Example: [SUCCESS] Downloaded and tagged: Thomas Bergersen - Elysium

  - Example: [ERROR] Failed to download: Audiomachine - Guardians at the Gate (no YouTube match)

SKIPPED
  - Prefix: [WARNING]
  - Meaning: Track intentionally skipped (already exists, user cancelled, or unsupported format like Shorts).

Batch-Level Outcomes
--------------------
- Always log a summary line at the end of a batch:
  [INFO] Finished: X succeeded, Y failed, Z skipped

- If user selects "Retry failed only":
  [INFO] User selected: Retry failed only
  [INFO] Retrying N failed track(s)...
  ...
  [INFO] Retry finished: A succeeded, B skipped (already exists)


GUI Representation
------------------
- Color coding:
  INFO    → Grey/Blue
  SUCCESS → Green
  WARNING → Orange
  ERROR   → Red

- Progress bar:
  Advances on SUCCESS or FAILED
  Skipped tracks log instantly but don’t advance the bar

- Status line:
  Shows current track outcome in real time
  e.g. "Downloading (3/10): Two Steps From Hell - Victory"
       then updates to "✅ Success" or "⚠️ Skipped"
